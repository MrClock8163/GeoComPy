# GeoComPy

GeoComPy is a Python library providing wrapper functions for serial
communication protocols of Leica surveying instruments.

The package is mainly built around the GeoCom ASCII protocol, supported by
a number of total stations and other instruments running TPS1000, 1100, 1200
and other firmware. For some older instruments that do not support GeoCom,
the GSI Online command set is used for communication.
